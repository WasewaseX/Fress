## 1.0.0-beta (2026-09-24): the first real release

This is the real v1.0.0 of Fress. Every older test build (the whole alpha line and the first beta run) has been deleted from the Releases page, and the version number starts over at 1.0.0. If you still run one of those builds, install this one by hand once: the updater compares version numbers and never offers a lower one, so it will not suggest this release on its own. Android installs coming from the last test builds use the same signing key and can install straight over the old app; export a backup from the old build first if you want to be safe. Everyone else: welcome, this is the beginning.

### Downloads, the whole point of the app
- The catalog resolves the right installer for your device from each project's own release feed. Architecture aware everywhere: x64 and ARM64 on Windows (the app asks the machine for its real architecture, not the emulated one), Apple Silicon and Intel on macOS, per-ABI APKs on Android, and Linux builds that actually run on your CPU.
- Multi-product repos are pinned to the right release stream, so the Ente Photos button downloads Ente Photos and not another Ente app, and Tuta's desktop, Android and calendar builds never cross over.
- Linux tarballs in every common format resolve now (.tar.gz, .tar.zst, .tar.xz and friends), so Ollama, 7-Zip and Calibre download directly again.
- Archive-only distributions are supported (Syncthing, Whisper Desktop, LosslessCut ship zip or 7z files instead of installers), and builds kept around for old Windows ("Legacy") can no longer outrank the current installer.
- Bitwarden resolves from its clients repository plus a stable official download link; DevToys resolves even though its repo flags every release as a prerelease.
- Android apps that also live on F-Droid prefer the F-Droid build when the GitHub release carries no architecture marker, so updates keep installing cleanly.
- When an app genuinely has no direct file (VLC, Tor Browser, GIMP and friends publish on their own sites only), the batch toast says so and opens the official pages in one click. No fake fallbacks.

### Fixed
- A wrong product could be offered: repos that publish several apps from one repo (Ente, Tuta, Obsidian, Bitwarden) are filtered by release stream before any file is picked.
- A wrong operating system could be offered: archive files whose names name another OS (a macos zip on Windows, a linux zip on macOS) are refused outright.
- A wrong architecture can never be offered: the compatibility gate runs on every pick, catalog overrides included, and an Android device whose ABI cannot be read gets the universal APK only.
- Downloads verify every byte: the received size is checked against what the server promised, resumes validate the server's answer strictly, and a resume without a validator restarts cleanly instead of risking corruption.
- Windows on ARM gets native ARM builds of Fress and of catalog apps; hyphenated names like x86-64 and arm-64 are classified correctly, and a -CLI companion can never impersonate the app.

### The app
- Batch downloads with a download manager: progress, speed, pause and resume, retries, all locally.
- The Replace tab: pick what you use today in 28 categories and get vetted private alternatives, graded and sorted.
- Update channels (alpha, beta, stable) with checksum-verified self-updates.
- Fully translated into Persian, Spanish, French and German.
- 75 curated apps, each with its official icon shipped inside the app.
- 138 regression tests behind all of the above.
